Open up the `MathBoolOp.xcodeproj` file. Once in Xcode, navigate to the `MathMethods.swift` file. This is where you will be writing your code. This lab includes tests. In order to run the tests, press command + u (within Xcode).

**1.** Create a function, `add(a:b:)` which takes in two arguments. The parameter names should be `a` and `b` and both should be of type `Double`. This function should also return a `Double` value. In your implementation of this function, you should return back the result of adding both `a` and `b` together.

**2.** Create a function, `add(a:b:)` which takes in two arguments. The first parameter is named `a` of type `Int`. The second parameter is named `b` of type `Double`. This function should return back an `Int` value. In your implementation of this function you should return back the result of adding both `a` and `b` together. Hint: You will have to convert one type to another in your implementation.

**3.** Create a function, `isEqual(a:b:)` which takes in two arguments. The parameters names should be `a` and `b` and both parameters should be of type `Int`. This function should return back a `Bool` value. In your implementation of this function, you should return either `true` or `false` depending on one condition. Are both `a` and `b` equal to each other?

**4.** This question is very similar to the prior question (#3), except for one different. We will be working with `Double`s as the type of our arguments, and not `Int`s. Create a function, `isEqual(a:b:)` which takes in two arguments. The parameter names should be `a` and `b`, both of type `Double`. This function will return back a `Bool` and determine whether or not the values passed in are equal to one another.

**5.**You should notice that a function has already been created for you (relating to this question). The name of the function is `questionFive()`. It takes in no arguments and returns a `String` value. It's up to you to read the following question and come up with an answer choosing from either a, b, c or d. If you think the answer is c, then you should `return "c"` in your implementation.

Question: Can you make an equality check (==) with the following two values. 6.1 and 7.  Meaning, are we allowed (will it compile) if we write this code, `6.1 == 7`.

* a - We can't compare an Int against a Double. When making an equality check, both values need to be of the same type.
* b - We can compare both numbers without a problem.
* c - We can compare both numbers if we convert one type to be the same as the other.
* d - Both a & c.

**6.** Create a function, `compare(a:b:)` which takes in two arguments. The parameter names should be `a` and `b`, both of type `Double`. In your implementation of this function you should check the following condition: If `a` is less than `b` or `a` is greater than or equal to `100`, then you should return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

**7.** Create a function, `average(a:b:c:)` which takes in three arguments. The parameter names should be, `a`, `b` and `c`, all of type `Int`. This function should return back an `Int` value. In your implementation of this function, you should return the average of these three values.
